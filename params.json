{"name":"Build2","tagline":"","body":"# Build2\r\nOkay Now this Site hopefully does more and shows more to the viewers / hackers who want to bring this down.\r\n\r\nDont Worry You Hackers You are really suppose to make this thing crash. The only problem is Can you?\r\n\r\nNow This is going to have a lot more of information basically on what I have used in making this website.\r\n\r\nGoodluck, Trying to listen to what I say.\r\n\r\nTo make this text. What you are currently seeing is something taht GitHub has helped me to create. GiHub makes it possible for people to do more and create more on websites\r\nYou Might think that this is very easy. Well it is but in reality its not. Im using the more simplified version and if you do not like seeing numbers or texts flying everywhere\r\nI highly suggests getting support from others. \r\n\r\nTo Make a website you basically need to make a repository. Repository serves as like a little hard drive saved at the memory of Github's Storage. Meaning you have no more worries\r\nabout consuming you space for all of those perosnal stuff.\r\n\r\nWell im Already to line 17 and its only one thing i have Started to tell you.\r\n\r\nThats all it is today. Im not going to finish it because there is no sense at all since not much is really going to see this process.\r\nHope you Learned Something.\r\n\r\nThank You for You Cooperation.\r\n\r\n# Build 2 Branch 1\r\n\r\nThis is the 1st Branch of The 2nd Build of the Site Please Ignore.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
